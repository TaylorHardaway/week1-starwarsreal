Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...
    as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly 
    silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with 
    your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.
    I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should 
    be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a 
    fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise 
    to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 
    'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. 
    Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new 
    strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.

      General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs 
      you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable 
      to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under 
      attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have 
      placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory 
      systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see 
      this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate 
      hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
